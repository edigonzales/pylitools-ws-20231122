= Python &# ; INTERLIS
:revealjs_theme: simple
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

== Three flavours

* Jython
* GraalPy
* Shared Libs with Python Bindings

== Requirements 

* Linux or macOS
* Windows: WSL2 or something similar (e.g. Multipass)
* Clone repo: `https://github.com/edigonzales/pylitools-ws-20231122.git`

== Python loves INTERLIS, but...

* it still has something to do with Java ;)
* especially the ecosystem (e.g. tooling) can be confusing (for Python programmers)
* it focuses on writing Python code and integrating existing INTERLIS tools

== Jython

* Implementation of Python in Java
* Runs on the JVM
* Has access to Java classes / libraries

=== Let's code

=== Pro

* Easy to access Java classes
* Some tooling exists (e.g. Jip)

=== Con

* Python 2.7
* Cannot run Python modules with C extensions
* Everything seems to be outdated
* Start up time

== GraalPy

* Implementation of Python on top of GraalVM
* Primary goal is to support PyTorch and SciPy

=== Let's code

=== Pro

* Python 3.10
* Easy to access Java classes
* Can run Python modules with C extensions
* Interoperability with other Truffle languages (e.g. JS, Ruby, R, Java)

=== Con 

* Tooling 
* Start up time
* Experimental (still?)

== Shared Libs with Python Bindings

* Build a shared library ("dll") from Java class with GraalVM 
* Create Python Bindings
* `pip install ilivalidator`

=== Let's code

=== Pro

* Standard Python distribution
* Super fast start up time

=== Con

* Needs extra code (shared lib and Python module)
* Performance of shared lib (but gets better with every release)
* OS dependent

== Conclusion
